Model description:
Stan code that is based on "Comparison of chromatographic stationary phases using a Bayesian-based multilevel model". 
Simplified version of stan code that uses pKa as a predictor
one sigma
pKas and alphas without etas
no between analyte variabilty for dlogkw ans dS1
dlogkw ans dS1 the same for acids and bases
