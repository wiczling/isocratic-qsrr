Model description:
Stan code that is based on "Comparison of chromatographic stationary phases using a Bayesian-based multilevel model". 
Simplified version of stan code that uses pKa as a predictor
one sigma
pKas and alphas without etas
between analyte variabilty for dlogkw and dS1
dlogkw ans dS1 the same for acids and bases

noncentered dlogkw and dS1
increasing adapt and treedepth does not help.
parameters seems wrong
